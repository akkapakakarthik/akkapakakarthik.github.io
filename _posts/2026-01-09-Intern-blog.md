# Summer Internship Blog

<!-- I received my offer letter today so I found it fitting to write a blog post before the intern taints my view of the company lol. It was about 8 months ago I got selected for a Systems Intern at Qualcomm. It was a wild ride (not so much) to get there. -->

If you are reading this, either you are really tensed about the intern season or are really bored and have nothing else to do. I remember reading blogs in the summer before my second year and was relieved to find some relatable people. I hope you find a similar kind of relief reading this, maybe calm your nerves a bit or at the very least, be a fun read :)

*(As this is my personal blog, this won't be completely about how to get a core intern so feel free to skip to the parts marked with a **.)*

## Background

More than half of my coaching was online due to covid. I had no real interest in engineering but was forced down this path because my brother tried this before. I had genuine interest in chemistry, organic especially due it being intuitive. I particularly struggled with Electrodynamics or anything even remotely related to EE. Fast forward to choosing my branch at IITB, I just went with whatever was the highest branch I could get. Now naive 2023 me had absolutely no idea what kind of decision that was or what he was getting himself into.

**Early Insti** 

First couple of semesters were really shitty, it was a highly competitive environment and I was expecting a bit of a break. It took some getting used to. Through a process of elimination, I figured core was what I wanted to do. As I was a DD student, I wanted to do some meaningful research and start as soon as I could. This never really happened though. I decided to go down the apping path, early in the third sem, to get a univ intern in my second year. I thought if I showed enough enthu, put in just enough effort, someone would take me. After over 100 mails and only a handful of replies, all negative, things weren't looking great. I still have the spreadsheet of utter dissatisfaction.

In the fourth sem, I found the profs of one of the core courses really cool, their work that is. I mailed him, met him and discussed the possibility of a project which never took off due to other commitments (PoRs). There was another project I undertook with ITC which I unfortunately did not follow through with. That was a really stressful time of my life, acads took another plunge, almost failed a course (something I had never experienced before). Things were looking bleak.

**Off Season**

I got a core intern in a small company called Nanosniff. The project was quite straightforward, I needed to implement a device that was described in a publication, but with far less resources, using "jugaads". Not having enough guidance, I don't think I was able to contribute meaningfully.

Another thing was that I used to go home so tired that I couldn't physically do anything, which made my athlete self really dejected. Is this what corporate feels like? Just work blindly for 8 hours and go home and rest for the next day?
Maybe I didn't give it enough time, but I quickly made it a part time intern because I couldn't handle just sitting around for 8 hours and not doing something meaningful, not even learning anything. Maybe I was not meant for research either? The fact that I wasn't in the best mental state also compounded the despair. I began losing hope altogether.

<!-- I cannot imagine myself working a corporate job, a 9-5 everyday and live a monotonous un-happening life. I am still not sure how I can avoid that but that's a problem for future me.    -->

## 'tis the damn season

I started updating my second year resume late in the summer, barely managing to fill 2 pages. Again through elimination I rejected all the profiles that I could not possibly get or even sit for. This left me with just core, so I focused on Digital and Signal domains (most companies don't even open for DD, but EE core prefers DD). I figured I needed to give corporate a better chance and hopefully a big company with an intern program would do a better job of representing what corporate is like. I was hoping I would get TI as they give a PPO directly and you can do whatever in your 4th year.

TI came in late August. I knew some people had been studying all summer for this and I started a week ago even though I had collected resources back in the summer. I crammed everything I needed to study into one week.
I brushed up concepts from EE224, EE229 and EE325 for the tests. Most of the material was for analog domain as they take the most number of people in analog. I will give more details about the topics below. The tests were straightforward with basic concepts from the respective courses. The time constraint makes it slightly difficult but is manageable. It would be a good idea to ask your friends in other IITs for questions as they usually bring TI earlier. You can also ask any senior who prepped for core, they should also have some questions. It's better to have some idea of how the questions will be. Also it would be better to give some random tests even if you don't want to intern there, just to get exposure of how tests are.

**How to NOT give an interview****

I was shortlisted for the signal processing role and waitlisted for the digital role. One night before the interview, I should have done a mock interview with a senior instead, gone over my resume, strengthen the basics. But I chose to study advanced topics that were not taught to us in the course to have an edge. Bad bad choice. 

Focus on the **basics**. This list is not exhaustive but should cover everything needed for a signal processing interview:
- **System properties**: causality, stability, linearity, TI, memory
- **Convolution** (CT/DT) – analytical & graphical
- Impulse & step responses
- **Fourier transform** (CTFT/DTFT) – definitions, properties, symmetry
- DFT & FFT basics (if you are thorough with the basics)
- **Sampling theorem**, Nyquist rate, aliasing (deep understanding)
- Parseval’s theorem, shifting/scaling properties
- **Common puzzles** (search online)
- AM/FM basics (EE341 basics)
- PDF, CDF, PMF; Mean, variance, standard deviation
- Conditional probability, Bayes theorem
- Poles/zeros & stability, Laplace & Z-transform – ROC, stability
- 1st & 2nd order system time/freq response basics

I froze during the intro. I went completely blank, no thoughts in my mind. The interviewers were chill thankfully and I regained some composure. I messed up easy questions so they never got to difficult topics. The interviewers will help you, try to guide you to the answer. **Think out your thoughts** (cliche i know but very crucial), they want to test how you think rather than you getting everything correct. One thing that helped me was thinking they probably did their bachelors from here and went through a similar process. Interviews can seem very daunting but at the end they are just conversations. 

I knew I was not going to TI after the interview. I just went home to eat, I couldn't stay in LHC anymore. 
I got a call in like 30 minutes that I had been shortlisted for the digital role as well. I was not very confident because of the SP interview and also the fact that I had not studied for a digital interview whatsoever. The panel I was sent to had already selected 2 students and sent them straight to the HR round. I don't think they was very keen to take more people. The interview went alright but they didn't seem interested, kept looking at their phones. No hopes from that interview either. The entire day was really depressing considering the fact that TI took some 30 odd people, most of who were from DD.

**How to give an interview**

Let me re-iterate, focus on the BASICS. Get your resume reviewed by seniors. Do a mock interview with them. Solve some puzzles. And chill out the day before the interview, try not to take a shitload of stresss. If you have worked hard, you will get in. Yes, there might be some luck involved but you just need to accept what is. And even if you don't, its not the end of the world, there will be plenty more opportunities ahead. Like Qualcomm was for me.

I was done with wanting a systems intern so applied for the hardware intern at Qualcomm. The test had more of processor design rather than digital. They shortlisted me in systems lmao among many others, most of them had not given the systems test. A lot of seniors said Qualcomm asks more probability based questions for the systems role. I tried not to make the same mistakes again. The interview went well and they took 3 rounds for me specifically, mostly basic SP, probability and some easy puzzles. The interview was online and the interviewers started asking technical questions straightaway. A friend called the same evening informing that I was selected. I was just glad that I didn't need to go through more of this tiresome process.

**Internship**

Will update it once I actually do the intern.

## Closing Remarks

If you read the whole thing, thanks man (maybe I should do more of this?) and all the best for your intern season! This was inspired by and an adaptation of [Adway Girish's Blog](https://adwaygirish.github.io/blogs/7-21_intern). Feel free to hit me up, I will be glad to help.
